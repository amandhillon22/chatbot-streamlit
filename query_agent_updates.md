# Required Updates to query_agent.py for Transportation Database

Based on your database reference showing a transportation/fleet management system, here are the specific Pagila references that need to be updated:

## Changes Required:

### 1. Line ~85 - Example references:
**Replace:**
```
"these 10 films", "that result", "total replacement cost"
```
**With:**
```
"these 10 vehicles", "that result", "total distance covered"
```

### 2. Line ~87 - Context examples:
**Replace:**
```
a recent list of 10 films or a selected category
```

```
"Just to confirm: do you want the total distance covered by all vehicles in the database, or only the 10 recently listed ones?"
```

### 4. Line ~116-117 - Time range examples:
**Replace:**
```
"earliest rental date", "rentals in the last month"
```
**With:**
```

```

**Replace:**
```
Use `MIN()` and `MAX()` on timestamp columns (like `rental.rental_date`)
```
**With:**
```
Use `MIN()` and `MAX()` on timestamp columns (like `alert_ign.date_time` or relevant trip tables)
```

### 5. Line ~122 - Example explanation:
**Replace:**
```
"To get the full range of rental activity, we'll look at the `rental.rental_date` column using MIN() and MAX()."
```
**With:**
```
"To get the full range of vehicle activity, we'll look at the `alert_ign.date_time` column using MIN() and MAX()."
```

### 6. Line ~124-125 - Latest activity example:
**Replace:**
```
"latest rentals"
"Check the max value of the rental date column"
```
**With:**
```
"latest trips"
"Check the max value of the trip/alert date column"
```

### 7. Line ~154-155 - Date range examples:
**Replace:**
```
The **MIN/MAX** of a datetime field (e.g., `rental_date`)
The **most recent month** (`MAX(rental_date)` then group or filter)
```
**With:**
```
The **MIN/MAX** of a datetime field (e.g., `date_time`)
The **most recent month** (`MAX(date_time)` then group or filter)
```

### 8. Line ~159 - Field example:
**Replace:**
```
Which **field** is being used (e.g., `rental.rental_date`)
```
**With:**
```
Which **field** is being used (e.g., `alert_ign.date_time`)
```

### 9. Line ~161 - Record types:
**Replace:**
```
Whether the request includes **only returned items**, **active rentals**, or **all records**
```
**With:**
```
Whether the request includes **only completed trips**, **active routes**, or **all records**
```

### 10. Line ~167 - Entity switching example:
**Replace:**
```
If the user switches from one entity (e.g., *customer*) to another (e.g., *product*)
```
**With:**
```
If the user switches from one entity (e.g., *vehicle*) to another (e.g., *route*)
```

### 11. Line ~274 - Relevant row labels:
**Replace:**
```

```

### 12. Line ~277 - Key extraction:
**Replace:**

**Replace:**
```
If the user switches from talking about one entity (like "product") to another (like "customer")
```
**With:**
```

```

## Summary:
These changes will align your prompting with your transportation database that includes:
- Vehicles (with reg_no)
- Routes and trips
- GPS tracking data (alert_ign table)
- Time-based activity tracking

The general logic and structure remain the same - only domain-specific examples are updated.
