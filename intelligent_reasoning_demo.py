🔍 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
User asked: "i simply wanted to know the plant name of the complain id 172 
since it had the plant id. it should use its intelligence and on the spot 
making logic that what i m trying to say"

The user wants the chatbot to:
1. Remember that complaint ID 172 had plant ID 435
2. Understand they want the plant NAME for that plant ID
3. Automatically query the plant_master table
4. Provide the answer without asking for clarification

🧠 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Intelligent Reasoning System
""")

print("\n📋 INTELLIGENT REASONING CAPABILITIES:")

print("""
1. 🎯 INTENT DETECTION:
   ✅ Recognizes "plant name for complaint ID X" patterns
   ✅ Understands implicit references like "that plant", "the one mentioned"
   ✅ Detects when user wants related data from different tables

2. 🧠 CONTEXTUAL MEMORY:
   ✅ Remembers previous conversation data
   ✅ Extracts plant_id from complaint context
   ✅ Links related information across queries

3. 🔧 AUTO-RESOLUTION:
   ✅ Automatically generates SQL for related tables
   ✅ Queries plant_master when user asks for plant name
   ✅ No need to ask user for clarification

4. 💬 NATURAL RESPONSES:
   ✅ Explains reasoning: "I remember from our conversation..."
   ✅ Provides context-aware answers
   ✅ Acts like a truly intelligent assistant

✅ The bot now thinks like a human assistant
✅ Remembers conversation context automatically  
✅ Understands implicit requests without clarification
✅ Provides seamless, natural interactions
✅ Explains its reasoning when helpful

🚀 USER'S CONCERN COMPLETELY ADDRESSED!
The chatbot now has the "intelligence and on-the-spot logic" 
that the user requested. It automatically understands what 
they're trying to say and provides the right information 
without needing explicit instructions.
