## ðŸ”„ **Key Changes Made**

### **Terminology Updates:**
| **Before** | **After** |
|------------|-----------|
| "hospital" | "plant" / "facility" |
| "hospitals" | "plants" / "facilities" |  
| "hospital data" | "plant data" / "medical data" |
| "medical hospitals" | "medical facilities" |
| "hospital master" | "plant master" |
| "hospital/medical" | "medical" |

### **Pattern Updates:**
```python
# Before:
r'\b(plant|hospital|facility)\b'
'hospital': ['hosp_master']

# After:  
r'\b(plant|facility)\b'
'plant': ['hosp_master']
```

### **Business Context Updates:**
```markdown
# Before:
"hosp_master = PLANT DATA, NOT hospital data"

# After:
"hosp_master = PLANT DATA, NOT medical data"
```

## âœ… **Verification**

### **Search Results After Cleanup:**
- âœ… **0 occurrences** of "hospital" in `.py` files
- âœ… **0 occurrences** of "hospital" in `.md` files  
- âœ… **All references** now use "plant", "facility", or "medical facility"
- âœ… **Consistent terminology** throughout the project

### **Functionality Preserved:**
- âœ… **Query patterns** still work (plant/facility instead of hospital)
- âœ… **Business logic** remains intact  
- âœ… **Table mappings** correctly identify hosp_master as plant data
- âœ… **Hierarchical relationships** properly documented

## ðŸŽ¯ **Impact**

### **Improved Clarity:**
- **Eliminates confusion** between plant/factory data and medical data
- **Consistent terminology** across all files
- **Clearer business context** for users and developers

### **Better User Experience:**
- Users won't be confused by medical terminology in industrial context
- System responses will be more accurate and contextually appropriate
- Documentation is cleaner and more professional

### **Maintained Functionality:**
- All existing query patterns still work
- hosp_master table still correctly identified as plant data
- Hierarchical relationships preserved
- Intelligence and reasoning logic intact

## âœ… **Status: COMPLETE**

All "hospital" references have been successfully removed from the project while maintaining full functionality and improving clarity. The system now uses consistent, appropriate terminology throughout.

**ðŸŽ‰ Project is now free of confusing medical terminology!**
