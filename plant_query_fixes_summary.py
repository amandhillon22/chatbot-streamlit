🔍 ISSUES IDENTIFIED FROM USER CONVERSATION:

1. ❌ "Plant name for ID 460" returned "MU7" (plant_code, not plant_name)
2. ❌ "Mohali plant" couldn't be found
3. ❌ Bot confused plant_code with actual plant name
4. ❌ Poor table/column selection for plant queries
5. ❌ Lack of intelligent reasoning for plant-related queries

🎯 ROOT CAUSES:
- Enhanced table mapper not prioritizing plant_schedule correctly
- LLM using plant_code instead of site_name/cust_name for plant names
- Missing intelligent reasoning patterns for plant queries
- Inadequate guidance for plant name vs plant code distinction
""")

print("\n🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED:")

print("""
1. 🏭 ENHANCED TABLE MAPPER:
   ✅ Added specific priority mappings for plant queries:
      - 'plant name' → ['plant_schedule', 'plant_master']
      - 'mohali plant' → ['plant_schedule', 'plant_master']
      - 'plant id' → ['plant_schedule', 'plant_master']

2. 🧠 INTELLIGENT REASONING:
   ✅ Added new intent patterns:
      - 'plant name for ID X' → Auto-queries plant_schedule with site_name/cust_name
      - 'plant ID of mohali' → Auto-searches site_name/cust_name fields
      - 'site visit details of mohali plant' → Auto-joins tables

3. 📋 ENHANCED QUERY GUIDANCE:
   ✅ Added critical plant query guidance:
      - PLANT NAME = site_name or cust_name (NOT plant_code)
      - plant_code is just a short identifier like 'MU7'
      - Specific SQL examples for plant name queries

4. 🔄 INTELLIGENT SQL GENERATION:
   ✅ Auto-generates correct SQL for plant queries:
      - SELECT site_name, cust_name FROM plant_schedule WHERE plant_id = 460
      - SELECT plant_id FROM plant_schedule WHERE site_name ILIKE '%mohali%'

✅ Intelligent Reasoning: Auto-detects plant name queries and generates correct SQL
✅ Enhanced Table Mapping: Prioritizes plant_schedule for plant queries  
✅ Correct Column Usage: Uses site_name/cust_name for plant names (not plant_code)
✅ Better Search: Searches descriptive fields for plant names like 'Mohali'
✅ Smart Joins: Automatically joins site visit data with plant information

1. Start the chatbot: python flask_app.py
