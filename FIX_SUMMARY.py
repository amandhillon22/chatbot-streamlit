COMPREHENSIVE FIX SUMMARY: Plant/Vehicle/Region Query Issues
============================================================

ISSUE RESOLVED:
- System was misinterpreting hosp_master as "hospital" data when it actually contains PLANT data
- Queries like "vehicles in Mohali" were failing because the system didn't understand table relationships
- Column name errors (zm.name vs zm.zone_name) were causing SQL failures
- Inefficient queries using unnecessary zone_master joins for district-level data

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
====================

1. üè≠ CRITICAL TABLE CLARIFICATION:
   - Added explicit guidance that hosp_master = PLANT DATA (not hospitals)
   - Updated all prompts to clarify table meanings
   - Added warnings against misinterpreting table names

2. üîë CORRECT COLUMN USAGE:
   - zone_master.zone_name (NOT zone_master.name)
   - district_master.name (for regions/states)
   - hosp_master.name (for plant names)
   - vehicle_master.reg_no (for vehicle registration)

3. üéØ SMART LOCATION DETECTION:
   - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab ‚Üí district_master.name (most efficient)
   - Only use zone_master when specifically asking for zone data
   - Avoid unnecessary hierarchical joins

4. üöõ VEHICLE-PLANT RELATIONSHIP FIXES:
   - "Vehicles in Mohali" ‚Üí JOIN vehicle_master with hosp_master on plant name
   - Proper use of id_hosp relationship
   - Flexible matching with ILIKE '%plant_name%'

WORKING QUERIES AFTER FIX:
===========================

‚úÖ "show me plants in Gujarat"
   ‚Üí SELECT hm.name FROM hosp_master hm JOIN district_master dm ON hm.id_dist = dm.id_no WHERE dm.name ILIKE '%Gujarat%'

‚úÖ "show vehicles in mohali" 
   ‚Üí SELECT vm.reg_no FROM vehicle_master vm JOIN hosp_master hm ON vm.id_hosp = hm.id_no WHERE hm.name ILIKE '%mohali%'

‚úÖ "plants in Punjab"
   ‚Üí SELECT hm.name FROM hosp_master hm JOIN district_master dm ON hm.id_dist = dm.id_no WHERE dm.name ILIKE '%Punjab%'

BEFORE vs AFTER COMPARISON:
=============================

‚ùå BEFORE (Broken):
- "show me plants in Gujarat" ‚Üí ERROR: column zm.name does not exist
- "show vehicles in mohali" ‚Üí ERROR: system misunderstood table relationships
- Used unnecessary zone_master joins for district-level queries

‚úÖ AFTER (Fixed):
- All queries work correctly with proper table understanding
- Efficient SQL generation with minimal necessary joins
- Correct column names throughout the hierarchy
- hosp_master correctly interpreted as plant data

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
=================
1. üéØ Smart table interpretation (hosp_master = plants, not hospitals)
2. üîß Efficient query generation (avoid unnecessary joins)
3. üîë Correct column name usage (zone_name, not name)
4. üß† Better location detection (district vs zone)
5. üöõ Proper vehicle-plant relationship handling

IMPACT:
=======
- User queries like "vehicles in Mohali" now work correctly
- Geographic queries are more efficient and accurate
- No more column name errors
- Better understanding of the actual data model
- Faster query execution with fewer unnecessary joins

The system now correctly understands that:
- hosp_master contains PLANT/FACTORY data (despite the name)
- Most geographic queries involve districts, not zones
- Vehicle-plant relationships use the id_hosp foreign key
- Column names must be used exactly as they exist in the schema
