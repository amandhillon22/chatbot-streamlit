## 🎯 Driver Query Processing Capabilities

### License Management Queries
```sql
-- Example: "Find drivers with expiring licenses"
SELECT 
    dm.id_no,
    CONCAT(dm.first_name, ' ', dm.last_name) AS driver_name,
    dm.lic_no AS license_number,
    dm.lic_exp AS license_expiry,
    CASE 
        WHEN dm.lic_exp < CURRENT_DATE THEN 'EXPIRED'
        WHEN dm.lic_exp <= CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'EXPIRES_SOON'
        ELSE 'VALID'
    END AS license_status
FROM driver_master dm
WHERE dm.lic_exp <= CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '90 days'
```

### Plant Assignment Analysis
```sql
-- Example: "Show drivers assigned to plants"
SELECT 
    dm.id_no,
    CONCAT(dm.first_name, ' ', dm.last_name) AS driver_name,
    dm.d_code AS driver_code,
    hm.name AS assigned_plant,
    hm.hosp_code AS plant_code
FROM driver_master dm
LEFT JOIN hosp_master hm ON dm.id_depo = hm.id_no
WHERE dm.id_depo IS NOT NULL
```

### Uniform Size Distribution
```sql
-- Example: "Uniform size distribution analysis"
SELECT 
    dm.tshirt_size,
    COUNT(*) AS driver_count,
    STRING_AGG(CONCAT(dm.first_name, ' ', dm.last_name), ', ') AS drivers
FROM driver_master dm
WHERE dm.tshirt_size IS NOT NULL AND dm.tshirt_size != ''
GROUP BY dm.tshirt_size
ORDER BY dm.tshirt_size
```

### Service Duration Analysis
```sql
-- Example: "Years of service for drivers"
SELECT 
    dm.id_no,
    CONCAT(dm.first_name, ' ', dm.last_name) AS driver_name,
    dm.dt_of_joining,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, dm.dt_of_joining)) AS years_of_service,
    hm.name AS assigned_plant
FROM driver_master dm
LEFT JOIN hosp_master hm ON dm.id_depo = hm.id_no
WHERE dm.dt_of_joining IS NOT NULL
```

## 📊 Key Business Rules Implemented

### 1. Name Display Format
- **Storage:** `first_name` and `last_name` in separate columns
- **Display:** `first_name + ' ' + last_name` (firstname lastname format)
- **SQL:** `CONCAT(dm.first_name, ' ', dm.last_name) AS driver_name`

### 2. Plant Assignment Relationship
- **Link:** `driver_master.id_depo` → `hosp_master.id_no`
- **Purpose:** Determines which plant/depot the driver is assigned to
- **Usage:** Essential for plant-specific driver queries

### 3. License Monitoring System
- **Expiry Tracking:** Monitor `lic_exp` for upcoming renewals
- **Status Categories:** EXPIRED, EXPIRES_SOON (30 days), VALID
- **Compliance:** Critical for fleet operations and legal requirements

### 4. Unique Constraint Management
- **Driver Code:** `d_code` (unique alphanumeric identifier)
- **License Number:** `lic_no` (unique driving license)
- **Contact:** `telephone` (unique mobile number)

### 5. Reference System
- **Primary Key:** `id_no` in `driver_master`
- **External References:** Tables with `drv_id`, `driver_id`, or similar columns
- **Relationship:** Many tables can reference the same driver

## 🔍 Entity Extraction Capabilities

The system can automatically extract and recognize:

### Driver Names
- Patterns: "driver John", "named John Smith", "called John"
- Usage: Enables natural language driver lookups
- Confidence: 0.8

### Plant Names  
- Patterns: "plant Delhi", "at Mumbai", "depot Chennai"
- Usage: Filter drivers by plant assignment
- Confidence: 0.7

### Driver Codes
- Patterns: "d_code DRV001", "driver code ABC123", "code XYZ"
- Usage: Precise driver identification
- Confidence: 0.9

### License Numbers
- Patterns: "license DL1234567890", "lic_no MH123456"
- Usage: License-based driver searches
- Confidence: 0.9

## 🧪 Integration Test Results

3. **Entity Extraction:** `extract_entities()` finds names, plants, codes
4. **SQL Generation:** `generate_driver_sql()` creates appropriate query
5. **Response:** Context-aware response based on query type
